# Travel & Notes - Installation guide

## Where to install Travel & Notes?

Of course Travel & Notes can be installed on a web server. It can also be installed on a computer disk and used locally.

### Installation Guide for Nulls

No great computer skills? If the demo suits you, you can download it by going to the gh-pages branch.
Still too complicated? follow this link directly (https://github.com/wwwouaiebe/leaflet.TravelNotes/archive/gh-pages.zip) which allows you to download the demo.
Open the zip file and install its contents in a directory on your PC or on your server and open the index.html file. That's all :-).

__**Warning:**__ following the discovery of a security hole in [JavaScript object XmlHttpRequest] (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-21/#CVE-2019-11730) it is no longer possible to run TravelNotes from a directory
on a PC without making any changes to the browser configuration. For Firefox, change the value of ** privacy.file_unique_origin ** in ** about: config ** to continue using TravelNotes locally.
You make this change at your own risk and we advise you to understand the risks before modifying anything. For Chrome and Edge, see the documentation.

### Installation guide for geeks

#### What to do in the HTML file?

The installation procedure is changed since the release v1.4.0. TravelNotes can no longer be installed in a Leaflet control, so you have to create a div in the html page.
and install TravelNotes.

Travel & Notes uses [Leaflet] (http://leafletjs.com/) to display the map. You must therefore download and install Leaflet.

In the &lt;head&gt; of the html file, load the Leaflet and TravelNotes stylesheet and create a style tag for the TravelNote map and control:

```
<head>
	...
	<style>
		body { font-family: sans-serif; font: 12px/1.5 "Helvetica Neue", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; }
		#TravelNotes { position: absolute; top: 0px; right:0px; z-index: 1200;}
		#Map { position: absolute; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;	max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh; top: 0px; left: 0px; overflow:none;}
	</style>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="leaflet/leaflet.css" />
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="TravelNotes.min.css" />
	...
</head>
```

And in the &lt;body&gt; create a &lt;div&gt; for the map, a &lt;div&gt; for TravelNotes, load Leaflet, TravelNotes and TravelNotes plugins
and install the map and TravelNotes in their respective &lt;div&gt;.

```
<body>
	...
	<div id="Map">
	<div id="TravelNotesControl"></div>
	...
	<script src="leaflet/leaflet.js"></script><noscript>Oh oh. Javascript is not enabled. It's impossible to display this page without javascript.</noscript>

		(function( ) 
		{
			'use strict';
			// Leaflet installation. See Leaflet documentation
			var Map = L.map ( 'Map' ).setView( [ 50.50923,5.49542 ], 17 );
			L.tileLayer ( 'http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', { attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright" title="Contributeurs de OpenStreetMap">Contributeurs de OpenStreetMap</a> | &copy; <a href="http://www.ouaie.be/" title="http://www.ouaie.be/">wwwouaiebe</a>' } ).addTo ( Map );
			// TravelNotes installation
			L.travelNotes.addControl ( Map, "TravelNotesControl");
			L.travelNotes.rightContextMenu = true;
		} ());		
	</script>
	...
</body>
```

#### The contents of the  TravelNotesNoteDialog.json file

This file contains the definitions of the buttons and list of predefined icons of the note editing box. These definitions can be adapted to your needs.

Sample file with 3 buttons and 2 predefined icons:

```
{ "editionButtons" : 
	[
		{
			"title" : "<span style='color:white;background-color:blue'>Blue</span>",
			"htmlBefore" : "<span style='color:white;background-color:blue'>",
			"htmlAfter" : "</span>"
		}, 
		{
			"title" : "<span style='color:white;background-color:red'>Red</span>",
			"htmlBefore" : "<span style='color:white;background-color:red'>",
			"htmlAfter" : "</span>"
		}, 
		{
			"title": "Ø",
			"htmlBefore": "Ø"
		}
	],
	"preDefinedIconsList" :
	[
		{
			"name" : "Vélos admis",
			"icon" : "<div class='TravelNotes-MapNote TravelNotes-MapNoteCategory-0005'></div>",
			"tooltip" : "Vélos admis",
			"width" : 40,
			"height" : 40
		},
		{
			"name" : "Autobus",
			"icon" : "<div class='TravelNotes-MapNote TravelNotes-MapNoteCategory-0006'></div>",
			"tooltip" : "Autobus",
			"width" : 40,
			"height" : 40
		}
	]
}
```

Two collections of objects __must__ be present in the file: "editionButtons" for the additional buttons and "preDefinedIconsList" for the predefined icons. These collections may be empty
but must be present.

Each object in the "editionButtons" collection has two or three properties;

- __title__ : the text that will appear on the button in the dialog box
- __htmlBefore__ : the text that will be inserted before the selection when the button is clicked
- __htmlAfter__ : the text that will be inserted after the selection when the button is clicked. This property is optional.

Each object in the "preDefinedIconsList" collection has five properties:

- __name__ : the name that will be displayed in the drop-down list (text)
- __icon__ : the content of the icon (html)
- __tooltip__ : the content of the tooltip (html)
- __width__ : the width of the icon in pixels
- __height__ : the height of the icon in pixels

#### The contents of the configuration file that can be loaded with the button &#x23CD;

The organization of this file is identical to the file TravelNotesNoteDialog.json

### Translations

Travel & Notes is translated into 'fr' and 'en'. If you want to translate Travel & Notes into another language, copy the TravelNotesEN.json file and rename it according to the language used. Then,
edit this file and translate all the lines in the desired language.
To load Travel & Notes in another language, add to the url lng = and the language to use (example to use Travel & Notes in english: https://wwwouaiebe.github.io/leaflet.TravelNotes/?lng=en.)

The organization of these files is as close as possible to that of [GNU getText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext)
